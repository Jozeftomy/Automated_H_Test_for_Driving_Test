# Automated_H_Test_for_Driving_Test
Our project aims to combat corruption in Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) by leveraging IoT technology. Using ultrasonic sensors, laser diodes, LDRs, and an Arduino UNO R3 board, we monitor driving H-Test maneuvers and detect irregularities in real-time. This system provides immediate notifications of errors and line-cutting incidents, reducing the opportunity for bribery. The data collected is accessible to governmental and road transport authorities, ensuring transparency and improving public safety by accurately evaluating drivers' skills. Our platform is supported by a MERN stack website, utilizing MongoDB, React, Node.js, and Express.js.
